`git pull` and `git fetch` are two commands used in Git for updating your local repository with changes from a remote repository¹. Here's how they differ:

- `git fetch`: This command updates your local repository with details of changes made in the remote repository². It writes logs, refspecs, objects, and other resources to the local repository². However, it does not merge any changes into your working directory². This is useful for checking changes to a remote branch without changing the working directory². After updating the local repo with `git fetch`, you can run `git merge` to update the working directory².

- `git pull`: This command does a `git fetch` followed by a `git merge`¹. It updates your remote-tracking branches and brings a local branch up-to-date with its remote version¹. In other words, `git pull` copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory³.

In summary, `git fetch` is a safe way to review changes before integration, while `git pull` is a quicker way of updating your repository if you're ready to incorporate the new commits immediately⁴.

Here's a simple analogy: `git fetch` is like asking a friend to tell you about the changes they've made to a shared project, while `git pull` is like asking your friend to tell you about the changes and then immediately applying those changes to your own work⁵.

`git merge` and `git rebase` are two different ways of integrating changes from one branch into another in Git¹. Here's how they differ:

- `git merge`: This command takes the contents of a feature branch and integrates it with the target branch³. When you merge one branch into another, a new merge commit is created that points to both branches¹. The key advantage of `merge` is that it preserves the history as it happened⁵. However, this can lead to a non-linear history which can be hard to follow¹.

```bash
# Merging feature branch into main branch
git checkout main
git merge feature
```

- `git rebase`: This command moves or combines the commits of the feature branch on top of the base branch¹. When you rebase, Git applies the commits one by one onto the base branch¹. The key advantage of `rebase` is that it results in a cleaner, linear project history¹. However, `rebase` rewrites the history, which can be risky if you're working on a public branch with other collaborators¹.

```bash
# Rebasing feature branch onto main branch
git checkout feature
git rebase main
```

In summary:
- Use `merge` when you want to combine code from two different branches and preserve the exact historical record¹⁵.
- Use `rebase` when you want to make your feature branch up to date with the latest code from the main branch¹. This keeps your feature branch's history clean and easy to follow¹.

Remember, both `merge` and `rebase` can lead to conflicts if there are incompatible changes in the branches. These conflicts will need to be resolved before the `merge` or `rebase` can continue¹.

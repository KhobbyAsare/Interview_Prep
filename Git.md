Sure, here's a brief explanation of the differences between `git pull`, `git fetch`, and `git rebase`:

- **`git fetch`**: This command updates your remote-tracking branches under `refs/remotes/<remote>/`. It fetches the latest changes from the remote repository, but it doesn't merge those changes into your local branch¹². This operation is safe to run at any time since it never changes any of your local branches.

- **`git pull`**: This command is a shorthand for `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. It fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and then merges those changes into your local branch¹². In other words, `git pull` brings a local branch up-to-date with its remote version, while also updating your other remote-tracking branches.

- **`git rebase`**: This command is more advanced. It allows you to replay your local commits on top of the latest changes from the remote repository³. The `rebase` rewrites your history, making it look as if you had committed on top of the remote's new branch, instead of where you originally committed¹. You should never use the `rebase` approach if someone else has already pulled from your branch.

Remember, both `git pull` and `git rebase` can lead to the same content in your work tree, but they create different histories. If you want to maintain a linear project history free of unnecessary merge commits, you might prefer to use `git pull --rebase`.

The `git commit --amend` command is a convenient way to modify the most recent commit¹². It lets you combine staged changes with the previous commit instead of creating an entirely new commit¹². It can also be used to simply edit the previous commit message without changing its snapshot¹². But, amending does not just alter the most recent commit, it replaces it entirely, meaning the amended commit will be a new entity with its own ref. To Git, it will look like a brand new commit.

Here are a few common scenarios for using `git commit --amend`¹²:

- **Change most recent Git commit message**: If you made a mistake in your commit log message, you can edit the previous commit’s message without altering its snapshot¹². Here's how you can do it:

  ```bash
  git commit --amend -m "an updated commit message"
  ```

  Adding the `-m` option allows you to pass in a new message from the command line without being prompted to open an editor.

- **Changing committed files**: If you've edited a few files that you would like to commit in a single snapshot, but then you forget to add one of the files the first time around. Fixing the error is simply a matter of staging the other file and committing with the `--amend` flag.

Please note that messing with the commit history of a repository can be dangerous. It is usually ok to make these kinds of changes to your own local repository. However, you should avoid making changes that rewrite history to remote repositories, especially if others are working with them.

The `git commit --amend` and `git commit --amend --no-edit` commands are used to modify the most recent commit in Git². Here's how they differ:

- **`git commit --amend`**: This command is used when you want to modify the most recent commit. It will open your editor of choice and allow you to change the commit message². You can also add new changes to the staging area and include them in the commit. For example, if you forgot to add a file to the commit, you can add it and then run `git commit --amend`.

- **`git commit --amend --no-edit`**: This command is similar to `git commit --amend`, but it reuses the existing commit message. This means that your editor won't open and the commit message won't be changed. This is useful when you've made a change to the commit (like adding a file you forgot to include), but you don't want to change the commit message.

Remember, both of these commands replace the most recent commit with a new one. This can be dangerous if you've already pushed your commits to a remote repository, as it changes the commit history. So, use these commands carefully.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain `bind`, `call`, and `apply` functions in JavaScript.

**Bind**
The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value¬≤. It's usually used when you want to pass a function to an event handler or other async callback‚Å¥. Here's an example:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}

const member = {
  firstName: "Hege",
  lastName: "Nilsen",
}

let fullName = person.fullName.bind(member);
```

In the above example, `fullName` is a new function bound to the `member` object¬≤.

**Call**
The `call()` method calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually¬π. Here's an example:

```javascript
function Car(type, fuelType) {
  this.type = type;
  this.fuelType = fuelType;
}

function setBrand(brand) {
  Car.call(this, "convertible", "petrol");
  this.brand = brand;
  console.log(`Car details = `, this);
}

const newBrand = new setBrand('Brand1');
```

In the above example, `Car.call(this, "convertible", "petrol")` in the `setBrand` function is used to call the `Car` function¬π.

**Apply**
The `apply()` method calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array (or an array-like object)¬π. `apply` is very similar to `call`, but in `apply` you can pass an array as an argument list¬π. Here's an example:

```javascript
function Car(type, fuelType) {
  this.type = type;
  this.fuelType = fuelType;
}

function setBrand(args) {
  Car.apply(this, args);
  this.brand = args[2];
  console.log(`Car details = `, this);
}

const newBrand = new setBrand(["convertible", "petrol", 'Brand1']);
```

In the above example, `Car.apply(this, args)` in the `setBrand` function is used to call the `Car` function¬π.

In summary, the `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` methods allow you to manipulate the `this` keyword in JavaScript functions¬≥. The `call()` and `apply()` methods are used to immediately invoke a function with a specified `this` value and arguments, while the `bind()` method returns a new function with a specified `this` value that can be called later¬≥.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. üòä


<!-- ................... -->

The `bind()`, `call()`, and `apply()` methods in JavaScript are all used to manipulate the `this` keyword in a function, but they do so in slightly different ways.

**Differences:**
- `call()` and `apply()` are quite similar. They both invoke the function immediately with a specified `this` value. The difference is in how additional arguments to the function are passed:
    - `call()` passes all function arguments after the first `this` value individually.
    - `apply()` passes all function arguments after the first `this` value as an array.
- `bind()`, on the other hand, does not immediately invoke the function. Instead, it returns a new function with the `this` value set to the provided value. This new function can be invoked later.

**When to use them:**
- Use `call()` when you want to use a function with a different `this` value and you know the arguments to pass to the function.
- Use `apply()` when you want to use a function with a different `this` value and the arguments to pass to the function are in an array or array-like object.
- Use `bind()` when you want to create a new function with a certain `this` value. This is often used when passing a function as a callback and you want to ensure it has the correct `this` value when it's called.
